It's more approachable interface, multitude of third party tutorials make Unity an attractive tool for beginners looking to learn game development.  </h5>

                                <h5>One such area being scene visualization. The ability to change aspects of a scene such as the lighting, environment, or camera positioning (more on that in a bit) and have the rest of the scene react immediately makes using a realtime workspace environment such as Unity perfect for such task as film previsualizations. The recent Lion King remake made great use of Unity to allow both the cast and crew, who were all unfamiliar with working in a fully digital environment, the ability to view the digital African landscape through a virtual reality headset, so that they might be able to go about their jobs as they would normally on an actual movie set. You can learn more about said undertaking here: <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-scene/how-jon-favreau-used-vr-technology-to-build-the-world-of-the-lion-king">AMC's interview with Jon Favreau </a></h4>  </h5>

                            		But why stop there. The graphical fidelity and realtime rendering advancements that Unity has made in the past few years has opened the door for CG content creators to make whole films all within the Unity Game Engine. These filmmakers all benifit from a realtime work environment in which they can have their animated scenes play out before them and make changes as it does. All without having to wait for it to bake again as they would in a program such as Blender in which the results are prerendered. Such is the case in the simple, realtime fluid simulation you see in the background. I was able to contort, expand and adjust the water particles as they fell and made contact with the cat's nose to get the look I wanted, all without having to wait to see the final results.

                                	Furthering their quest to give filmmakers the ability to play out their scenes in realtime, Unity aquired Cinemachine - A suite of tools for dynamic, procuedural virtual cameras that can greatly change the way filmmakers can compose and direct their scenes. The real beauty of Cinemachine in my person opinion is how beautifully it ties into Unity's other systems, such as their timeline sequencing feature. With these two combined features it is possible to completely change the way your scenes play out. With the timeline feature you can change the places your characters are standing as well as the speed at which they walk throughout the environment and based off the parameters you define Cinemachine will work to keep your original vision in realtime within the new scenario you've provided.

Combining this with Unity's cloud project service, which allows multiple people to work on a project at once, creative projects can come together at faster rates than ever before.
